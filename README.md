# Horiseon-seo-project
SEO Site Optimization Excersize

# Purpose
This excersize focused on code refactoring. We were given a source code and asked to declutter and organize it while making sure the links operated correctly. 

# Acceptance Criteria
1. Webpage meets accessibility standards.
2. The structure contains semantic HTML elements.
3. The source code follows a logical structure.
4. Images have alt attributes.
5. Heading attributes fall in sequential order.
6. The title element is concise and descriptive. 

# Corrective Actions
1. Application links corrected and function properly.
2. HTML corrected to follow semantic structure.
3. CSS selectors and properties organized and consolidated.
4. Comments added to CSS file.


# -- Notes --
Sometimes code refactoring is like spring cleaning.... The code gets a whole lot worse before it gets better and the best thing to do is to jump right in!!! The key is to pick a starting point and stick with it.
