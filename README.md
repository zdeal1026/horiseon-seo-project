# Purpose
This excersize focused on code refactoring. We were given a source code and asked to declutter and organize it while making sure the links operated correctly. 

# Corrections
1. Application links corrected and function properly.
2. Hoverable links added.
3. HTML corrected to follow semantic structure.
4. CSS selectors and properties organized and consolidated.
5. Comments added to CSS file.


# Notes
Sometimes code refactoring is like spring cleaning.... The code gets a whole lot worse before it gets better and the best thing to do is to jump right in!!! The key is to pick a starting point and stick with it. 

# Credits
Matierial and ideas borrowed from Trilogy Education services along with teachings from Anthony Cooper and Sasha Peterson.
